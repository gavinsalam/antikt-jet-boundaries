Anti-kt jet boundaries
======================

Code for visualizing boundaries of
[anti-kt](https://arxiv.org/abs/0802.1189) jets. Look in the
[plots/](plots/) directory to see a set of pre-generated plots.

If you want to generate modified plots, you'll need the following
prerequisites: 

- your own build of [fastjet](http://fastjet.fr/)
- root
- python

Adapt the python script [./gen-configs.py](./gen-configs.py) to get the
output that you need (note that you'll need to set the path to the
directory where you build fastjet).
